\begin{problem}{Keks Again?}{standard input}{standard output}{3 seconds}{keks2}

Mirko and Slavko are bored at math class again so they came up with new game. Mirko writes down an $n$ digit number, and Slavkoâ€™s task is to obtain the largest possible number after having removed exactly $k$ digits.

\InputFile

The input contains several test cases.\\
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $k$ $(1 \leq k < n \leq 500 000)$.\\
The following line contains and $n$ digit number. This number starts with non-zero digit.\\
The last line of the input contains two space-separated zeros and should not be processed.

\OutputFile

For each test case, output one integer number on a single line --- The largest possible number Slavko can obtain by removing $k$ digits from the given number $n$.
